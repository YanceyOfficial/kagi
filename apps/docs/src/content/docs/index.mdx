## What is Kagi?

Kagi is a self-hosted secret management system. It lets you store encrypted API keys, SSH private keys, environment configs, and 2FA recovery tokens — organized by key type and project, accessible through a web UI or REST API.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="AES-256-GCM encryption" icon="seti:lock">
    All secret values are encrypted at rest. Values are never returned by list or detail endpoints — only via explicit `/reveal` calls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scoped access keys" icon="seti:config">
    Create API keys with fine-grained scopes. Grant only `entries:read` for read-only automation, add `entries:reveal` for scripts that need values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Structured key types" icon="seti:db">
    Four key types: `simple` (single env var), `group` (multi-field map), `ssh` (key file), `json` (credential file).
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI extraction" icon="seti:html">
    Describe your project in natural language and get a ready-to-paste `.env` file. The AI sees only key names — never values.
