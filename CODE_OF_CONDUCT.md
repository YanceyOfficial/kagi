# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in Kagi and its community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, PRs, discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/YanceyOfficial/kagi/issues) or contacting the maintainer directly at yanceyofficial@gmail.com. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter.
